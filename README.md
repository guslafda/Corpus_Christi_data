# Corpus_Christi_data

In this repository, I am publishing data generated with the BERT model XPL, which is a version of LatinBERT retrained on the *Patrologia Latina* corpus from the *Corpus Corporum* project,
kindly made available to me by Philip Roelli at the University of Zürich (https://mlat.uzh.ch/browser?path=/38).

The data is a compilation of nouns and adjectives which have possibly undergone a semantic shift under the effect of Christianity. Note that some of them are false-positive, hence these word lists need to be verified in a qualitative analysis.
Also included are two metadata files, where the document_ids belonging to the documents included in the *Patrologia Latina* and *Latinitas Antiqua* corpora can be searched for.

For more information about how the data was compiled and a more detailed analysis, refer to:

Lafage, D. (2025). *Corpus Christi. En diakron korpuslingvistisk studie av kristendomens påverkan på latinsk semantik.* Göteborgs Universitet.
